The landing looks beautiful. But the background blue is too simple, maybe we can add some vectors like showing link connections between points, simulating a neuronal network of transport and shippment

I'll enhance the background with a neural network-like pattern to simulate transport connections. This will add more visual depth and better represent the transportation network concept.

Let's create this effect by adding a dynamic network pattern to the hero section background:


Executed mkdir -p assets

Created assets/network-bg.svg
Now let's update the CSS to use this network background and add some dynamic animation effects:


Edited css/styles.css
Now, let's extend the network pattern to other sections of the page as well. Let's update the Technology section and From The Fields section:


Edited css/styles.css
Now let's update the Technology section with the same network pattern:


Edited css/styles.css
Now let's update the truck illustration in the Technology section to integrate with the network background better:

Let's first view the correct structure of the tech illustration section:

Let's look at the Technology section:

I'm analyzing your recent work on the NEAR landing page. Here's what I've been doing:

✓ Added technology section with truck illustration
✓ Added "From The Fields" section
✓ Added modern hero section with split text styling
✓ Translated Problem/Solution section to English
✓ Implemented neural network-like background pattern
→ Enhancing the background with connection visuals

Based on your feedback about wanting a more dynamic background that simulates a network of transport connections, I've added the network-bg.svg and applied it to multiple sections with subtle animations.

I'm making good progress implementing the visual enhancements you requested and will continue refining the network visualization effects.
