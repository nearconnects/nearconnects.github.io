# Overview

NEAR (Never Empty Again on Return) is a logistics optimization platform that connects transporters with clients to reduce empty trips, cut COâ‚‚ emissions, and improve delivery efficiency. The platform consists of a marketing website with data insights dashboard and a separate data analytics component built with Streamlit and Python.

The project aims to solve the problem that 43% of logistics routes in Spain operate empty, causing operational losses and unnecessary emissions. NEAR provides an intelligent platform to optimize return routes and connect supply with demand in real-time.
